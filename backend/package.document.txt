1) express-validator
express-validator is a middleware for validating and sanitizing user input in Express.js apps.
When users submit data (like in a login or signup form), you want to make sure:
Required fields are filled.
Emails are valid.
Passwords meet strength requirements.
No malicious scripts or invalid input is sent.
express-validator helps do all that easily and securely.
